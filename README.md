# cyberpunk-2077-hacking-solver

A web-based solver for the Cyberpunk 2077 Breach Protocol hacking minigame.

## Development
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Testing
Any tests under `__tests__` will be run when executing `npm run test`.

When executing `npm run test:watch`, the Jest CLI is invoked with the `--watch` option ([see here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--watch])).

While watch is running the following commands may be used:
```bash
Watch Usage
 › Press a to run all tests.
 › Press f to run only failed tests.
 › Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern.
 › Press t to filter by a test name regex pattern.
 › Press q to quit watch mode.
 › Press Enter to trigger a test run.
```

#### TSLint
Run [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) for suggestions on a given file or directory, for example:
```bash
$ tslint -c tslint.json './lib/**/*.ts'
```

TSLint also has plugins to enable highlighting (and often automatically fixing) issues in a number of popular IDEs:
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)
- [WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/using-tslint-code-quality-tool.html)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-tslint)
